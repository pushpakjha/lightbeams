Completed:
v1:
 - Base gameplay
   - Matchmaking with two players
      - If odd number of players, play vs bot
   - Basic tron-like gameplay
   - Collision detection
 - Robust connection/disconnection handling, better matchmaking essentially
 - Large gameboard 3x
  - Moving view window, specific to each player

v2: 
- Support for more than 2 players; 6, 8 or 10? Can now control number of players with 1 variable in server.js
- Re-do robust connection/disconnection handling
- Constant movement, more tron-like, controlled by 1 flag
- Leaderboard, shows length of "light trail" as score and number of kills/deaths

v3:
- Add power-ups randomly around game board
- Graphics updates
  - View window dynamically re-sizes to browser size
  - Add background style, light grey boxes on dark background, using grid function for now
  - Add wall borders
  - Improve leaderboard visibility/style
  - Make players appear more like light-beams/light-bikes
    - Add glow effects like light, make glow stronger based on score, had to re-write animation engine twice
    - Use better color pallette
    - Add some kind of face to indicate direction
- Performance updates
  - Using off-screen canvas, now also using multiple canvas's for each layer
  - Eliminated matrixCount and other expensive functions
  - Changed animation to moveTo, lineTo and stroke rather than fillRect
  - Animation engine now collects x and y line segments and draws them, rather than each block as a line, was decent performance boost
- Mechanics
  - Speed of movement tied to your score, NEEDS TO ALSO TIE TO DELTA TIME
- Add intro page to enter name, display name, also add death page to respawn

v4:
- Host on a live server
- Ignore inputs which cause insta-self kill, ie if going right hitting left would kill you, so ignore. 
Technically, if going left/right only up/down inputs should change you and vice versa.
- Add help page to explain power-ups
- Bought domain name, lightbeams.io
- Added email feedback form on page, lightbeamsio@gmail.com
- Launched alpha test
  - Added bot for single players

In Progress: 8/6/2017
- Long-Term - Fine tune mechanics and graphics and performance
v4:
- Launch alpha test
  - Test and improve live server performance
  - Drive traffic to get feedback
    - Make video of bot

Up Next:
v5:
- Improve performance, likely hosting on a live server will have new challenges
  - Animation engine only renders differences from previous scene, seems not possible
  - Client-prediction based animation to look smooth
  - Eliminate large or numerous loops
  - Improve matchmaking
  - Add social media connections and sharing

v6:
- Convert to Android app

v7:
- Convert to Apple app
Minor bug list:
- Make new spawn pos of player/power-ups away from other "trails" or power-ups, right now too random
